## Overview
The Loan Management System (LMS) is designed to manage loan applications, client payments, and notifications. The tests here validate core features such as:

- **Loan Management**: Update loan details, approve loans.
- **Client Management**: Contact clients, view client payments.
- **Payments Management**: Track payments and balance updates.

### Features Tested
- Loan creation and updates
- Client registration and payments
- Payment processing and notifications

## Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed. You can download it from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Newman** (Postman’s CLI tool) installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g newman

Postman: Use Postman for managing and running API collections. Download from Postman Official Site.

## Configure Environment Variables
In Postman, open the Environment tab.

Ensure environment variables like {{base_url}}, {{password}}, {{client_id}}, {{loan_id }}, are correctly defined in the QA-lending-env.postman_environment.json file.

## Running tests
To run the automated API tests with Newman using the collection and environment:

- Navigate to the directory where the lending app testing.postman_collection.json and QA-lending-env.postman_environment.json are located.

- Run the following command:

- newman run 'lending app testing.postman_collection.json' -e QA-lending-env.postman_environment.json

This command will execute all the tests in the Postman collection using the provided environment.

## Generate Test Reports
```
newman run 'lending app testing.postman_collection.json' \
  -e QA-lending-env.postman_environment.json \
  --reporters cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export report.html
  ```
